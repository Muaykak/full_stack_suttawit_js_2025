      (Japanese: メイドインアビス, Hepburn: Meido in Abisu) is a
      <strong>Japanese manga series</strong> written and illustrated by Akihito
      Tsukushi. It has been serialized online in Takeshobo's digital publication

      volumes. The story follows <mark>an orphaned girl named Riko</mark>, who
      finds and befriends a part-robot boy named Reg, and descends with him into
      the titular "Abyss" that leads deep into the Earth, in hopes of exploring
      it and finding her mother. An anime television series adaptation produced
      by Kinema Citrus, aired from July to September 2017. A sequel film,
      subtitled Dawn of the Deep Soul, premiered in Japan in January 2020. A
      second season, subtitled The Golden City of the Scorching Sun, aired from
      July to September 2022. A sequel to the second season has been announced.
      A Western live-action film adaptation began development in 2021, with
      Kevin McMullin hired to write and direct. An action role-playing game
      developed by Chime Corporation and published by Spike Chunsoft was
      released in September 2022. By February 2020, the manga had over three
      million copies in circulation. In 2023, it won the 52nd Japan Cartoonists
      Association Award.
