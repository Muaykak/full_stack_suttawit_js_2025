          Faputa (ファプタ) is the final child of Irumyuui and is referred to as
          "Princess of the Narehate" by the inhabitants of The Village of
          Iruburu within the 6th Layer of The Abyss.[1] She is described by
          Majikaja as "the embodiment of Value", and is highly regarded by the
          Narehate of the village.[2] While the citizens of the village are
          unable to leave it, conversely, Faputa is unable to enter.[3][4] She
          can speak both the language of Iruburu and the language of the
          Delvers.[5][6] She is currently attached to Riko's delving squad,
          Hello Abyss.

          Nanachi is currently a member of Hello Abyss, and the tritagonist of
          Made in Abyss. Their gender is ambiguous.[2]</text
